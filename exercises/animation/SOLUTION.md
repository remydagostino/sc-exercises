# Ideas

Animating between two almost completely different screens is always tricky.

The first tempation is always to just do a crossfade because it is so easy. I wanted to use movement rather than a crossfade because:

- If you have no control of the elements being faded between then some crossfades can appear rather jarring.
- Crossfading offers no concept of precedence in the UI. It communicates no relationship between the two screens

I decided that the album cover sits on top of the track and wave form. I also didn't want to have the play button or wave-form anchored to their containers. I felt like they should be free to move to add an extra sense of play to the interface.

When I was trying to think of an appropriate movement, it came to mind that pressing that play button feels a like turning a key and opening a chest.

I liked the idea of teasing the user with what was under the box by revealinga little bit of the track cover and waveform when the cursor gets close to the play button.
