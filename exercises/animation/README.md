## Animation

Animations and transitions can be a great way to provide visual feedback to the user. A good user experience is not so much about how it looks, but about how it behaves. Of course, it’s important to find a good balance. Every transition and animation should be meaningful to the user. Done correctly, they can provide a great user experience or simply give the product this little extra touch.

For this challenge we provide you with 2 static imagesa lbeled `a.png` and `b.png`. The first image is a representation of a user profile embed, the second one of a playing track. Your job is to take the user from a to b. You can come up with all the steps in between. You can use as little or as many transitions or animations as you want.

Since we want you to have as much creative freedom as possible, you’ll have to come up with the DOM structure and styling from scratch. We do provide you with some basic assets, so you can focus on the most important part of this task.

### Notes

- SoundCloud embeds have to be able to adapt to their surroundings. That means that the design will have to be responsive, not only in width, but also in height.
- You can find the assets in the `/assets` folder.
- The `index.html` contains a resizable iframe which links to `embed.html`. You should only need to change `embed.html`.
- The waveform is normally drawn in canvas, but since that’s a completely other problem, we supply you with a static `waveform.png` image you can use as a background image.
- It’s not necessary to create an exact copy. If you think you have a good reason to change something, we encourage that, but please also tell us why you did.
- You don’t need to worry about audio playback handling. The waveform does not need to animate once you switch to the track view.

### Additionally...

In addition to this challenge, please include notes (simple bullet points would be fine) highlighting why you made certain decisions, and which problems you encountered on the way.
